# (Factors affecting loan status and interest rates in prosperLoanData dataset)
## by (Nigel Omondi Odongo)


## Dataset

> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate),
current loan status, borrower income, and many others. As a representative sample, I used about 15 variables and 700 records as the subset sample size.

## Summary of Findings

>Loan status is affected by whether a borrower is a homeowner or not.

> Most of the borrowers who defaulted on their loans are not homeowners, they are non homeowners.

> The borrowers annual percentage interest rate is not fixed or predicatble, it is dependent on occupation.

> The annual percentage interest rates for homeowners are generally low.

> A large number of homeowners were charged off and highest annual interest rates were flagged on those who were past due (31-60 days)

## Key Insights for Presentation

> The loan status is to a great extent dependent on whether a borrower is a homeowner or not, since we see homeowners being the ones with 
1. the highest current loan, 
2. fewer completed loan 
3. they default less on their loans.

The delay to complete loan payment could be due to them borrowing a lot to complete their projects that take time to bring back returns which in turn pays back their loans.
